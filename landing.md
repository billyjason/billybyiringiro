					<h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a solution to world’s problem!</h3>
				</header>
				<p>In contemporary time, Artificial Intelligence is not a sporadic term, but few comprehend its essence to the world’s problems. In 1956 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), John McCarthy, renowned as a father of AI, brought this term into existence. He put it “AI is the science and engineering of a making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs (I. T. L. Education Solutions Limited, 2009). “ Since then, the field has only proliferated on ever-increasing speed, as today we regard it as a computational model of human intelligence because of its practical applications witnessed on a daily basis, such as speech recognition, natural language processing, robotics, among many things. Moreover, the point view of AI has changed. It is currently not observed as an endeavour to resemble human intelligence only, but it is seen as an innovation to develop better technologies that “extend beyond” human “physical calibre (Kannan, 2017).” Granted, there is still major components of Artificial intelligence that are not yet discovered...</p>

					<h3>The implications of the rise of quantum computing in the real world</h3>
				</header>
				<p>After what was known as the last generation of computer revolutions “artificial intelligence and beyond,” it could now be regarded as a failure of imagination for computer scientist’s narrowmindedness not to believe that something rather than binary based computation would emerge. Through the harnessing the subject that was coined not earlier than a century ago, physicists discovered that new kind of computers could be developed that deploy quantum mechanics laws to achieve unheard-of speed and potential to solve problems that for conventional computers deemed to be intractable. Quantum computing is not a mere version of the ordinary computer with enhanced tools; it is, rather a “new paradigm,” in a way we understand computation. Unlike the traditional machines that employ binary bits of 1’s and 0’s in their processions, the quantum computers use quantum bits, commonly known as “qubits,” and, surprisingly, one kind of this bit can store the 1 and 0 states simultaneously, which is called superposition. This ability of superposition provides quantum computers with special advantages over traditional ones regarding the computational power and in the way of exploring countless configurations. Quantum computational capability is providing promising possibilities in discovering new drugs, new fertilizers, and other new technologies(Robinson, 2016). On the other hand, quantum computers is regarded as a double-edged sword, argues Michelle Mosca, in part because of its power to surpass the current digital computational mechanism in terms of speed and fundamental basic structure and because it can crack the current cryptographic systems that are commonly used in business organizations and government agencies (Moskowitz, 2016). Thus, the possibility of the advent of the full-fledged quantum computing presents an adversary threat to the current cybersecurity due to its unprecedented speed and technology...</p>
